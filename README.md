## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze Citibike data from NYC to determine if a similar type of business could be successful in Des Moines, IA. Although the cities are extremely different in demographics, the data can still be used to answer a number of questions:
* What days/times are the service used the most/least?
* Which gender uses the bikes more?
* How long are the bikes typically used?
